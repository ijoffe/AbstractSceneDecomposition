# Abstract Scene Decomposition

### Summary

This repository contains code to re-implement `MONet`, presented by Burgess et al. in ["MONet: Unsupervised Scene Decomposition and Representation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11390). I completed this project with Benjamin Colussi as part of the "CS679: Neural Networks" course in Winter 2025 at UWaterloo.

* **[`monet_normask.py`](https://github.com/CS479-679-W2025/final-project-monet-arcagi/tree/main/monet_normask.py) and [`monet_normask.ipynb`](https://github.com/CS479-679-W2025/final-project-monet-arcagi/tree/main/monet_normask.ipynb)**: These files contain the source code for the NoRMask version of MONet (with the `.ipynb` version containing deeper explanation of the code).
* **[`monet_mini.py`](https://github.com/CS479-679-W2025/final-project-monet-arcagi/tree/main/monet_mini.py) and [`monet_mini.ipynb`](https://github.com/CS479-679-W2025/final-project-monet-arcagi/tree/main/monet_mini.ipynb)**: These files contain the source code for the miniature version of MONet (with the `.ipynb` version containing deeper explanation of the code).
* **[`original_paper.pdf`](https://github.com/CS479-679-W2025/final-project-monet-arcagi/tree/main/original_paper.pdf)**: This file is the original paper for easy access.
* **[`report.pdf`](https://github.com/CS479-679-W2025/final-project-monet-arcagi/tree/main/report.pdf)**: This file is our project report.
* **[`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/CS479-679-W2025/final-project-monet-arcagi/tree/main/requirements.txt)**: This file contains the main packages that need to be installed for all project code to run.

Note that you may encounter issues when attempting to clone/pull this repository because of the use of Git Large File Storage (LFS), which enables the inclusion of the large dataset and model files. For best results, [ensure Git LFS is installed](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) on your system prior to cloning this repository. Additionally, make sure to clone this repository using HTTPS and Git LFS (i.e., run `git lfs clone https://github.com/CS479-679-W2025/final-project-monet-arcagi.git` and not the conventional `git clone git@github.com:<...>` command). If the large dataset files still do not download properly, try downloading them directly from [Google DeepMind](https://github.com/google-deepmind/multi_object_datasets). To run our code most effectively, create and activate a Python virtual environment (via `python -m venv env` and `source env/bin/activate`) and install the required dependencies (via `pip install -r requirements.txt`). Note that [special action](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) may be necessary to run our code with a CUDA-enabled version of PyTorch. Also note that model inference (e.g., when running [`demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/CS479-679-W2025/final-project-monet-arcagi/tree/main/demo.ipynb)) may be slow due to the substantial computational resources required by the model.
